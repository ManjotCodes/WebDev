# JavaScript Objects

You have already learned that JavaScript variables are containers for data values.

This code assigns a simple value (Fiat) to a variable named car:

let car = "Fiat";

Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

This code assigns many values (Fiat, 500, white) to a variable named car:

const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).

It is a common practice to declare objects with the const keyword.

Learn more about using const with objects in the chapter: JS Const.

## Object Definition

You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal:

Example
const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines:

Example
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};
